PSOAP
=================================

Precision Spectroscopic Orbits A-Parametrically (pronounced 'soap')

`PSOAP` is a package to model astronomical spectra nonparametrically, for the purposes of disentangling spectra (as in double-lined spectroscopic binaries) or simply determining orbits (in the case of (single-lined spectroscopic binaries or exoplanet hosts). For more information about the mathematical framework underlying `PSOAP`, please see our paper

*Disentangling Time Series Spectra with Gaussian Processes: Applications to Radial Velocity Analysis*, Czekala et al., ApJ, https://arxiv.org/abs/1702.05652
